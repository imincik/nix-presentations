## Testimonials

---
> **Your team** has helped me **gain skills on nix**, and I believe I am getting close
to **being autonomous on a technology that's really tough to master**. In my mind,
this is **capacity-building at its best**. There was obviously a lot of homework,
but your **guidance is invaluable**.

_Laurent Savaete, Alaveteli_

---

> I was **amazed by the quality of the work** done without any guidance when the
project was growing in complexity, then by the **patient and instructive help I
got afterwards**.

_Benjamin Somers, 0WM_
